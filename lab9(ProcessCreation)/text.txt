Twenty days on the grain and drain train for Andy down there in solitary. It was his second jolt in solitary, and
his dust-up with Norton was his first real black mark since he had joined our happy little family.
I'll tell you a little bit about Shawshank's solitary while we're on the subject. It's something of a throwback to
those hardy pioneer days of the early to mid-1700s in Maine. In those days no one wasted much time with
such things as "penology" and "rehabilitation" and "selective perception." In those days, you were taken care
of in terms of absolute black and white. You were either guilty or innocent. If you were guilty, you were either
hung or put in gaol. And if you were sentenced to gaol, you did not go to an institution. No, you dug your own
gaol with a spade provided by the Province of Maine. You dug it as wide and as deep as you could during the
period between sunup and sundown. Then they gave you a couple of skins and a bucket, and down you went.
Once down, the gazer would bar the top of your hole, throw down some grain or maybe a piece of maggoty
meat once or twice a week, and maybe there would be a dipperful of barley soup on Sunday night. You pissed
in the bucket, and you held up the same bucket for water when the gazer came around at six in the morning.
When it rained, you used the bucket to bail out your gaol-cell . . . unless, that is, you wanted to drown like a
rat in a rainbarrel.
